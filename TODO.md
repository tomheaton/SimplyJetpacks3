# Simply Jetpacks 3 - Todo List

### General
- Make the creative jetpack glow 
- Add armored variants of jetpacks
    - make the armor retrievable 
    - render normal chest armor + jetpack model _(this will also help with normal jetpacks showing the leather strap around the player)_
- Actually make jetpacks fly
- Then make them need energy _(start with ForgeEnergy (FE))_
- Add Mekanism Integration (special variants, recipes, energy compatibility)


### Bugs to squash
- **_No known bugs yet_**

### Far in the Future _(waiting on mods getting updated to 1.16.1)_
- Integrate RedstoneFlux API
- Integration with EnderIO, Applied Energistics, and Thermal Dynamics
